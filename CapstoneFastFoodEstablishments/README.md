# Locating a Fast Food Restaurant

In order to assist a potential franchisee in optimally locating for a retun on investment, we apply statistical analysis and machine learning methods to distinguish successful areas from non successful areas. The investigation is limited to the city of Philadelphia due to financial constraints in procuring current information on existing establishments and patronage but the methods followed in this project can be generalized to an increased amount of locations and leaves room for expansion of investigation.

We use a subset of the census variables provided by [Safegraph](https://www.safegraph.com/open-census-data), [crime statistics provided by the city of Philadelphia] (http://metadata.phila.gov/#home/datasetdetails/5543868920583086178c4f8e/representationdetails/570e7621c03327dc14f4b68d/), and walk and transit scores provided by [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com) as predictor variables to model output variables of fast food consumer count and patronage obtained from [Safegraph's data shop](https://shop.safegraph.com). As the bulk of our input variables relate to Census Block Groups as input areas, we map all our information to CBGs utilizing the [census geocoding service](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder) and [Google Maps API](https://maps.googleapis.com).
